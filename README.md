*Cache coherence simulation* 

This simulation represents how the cache performs to maintain the coherence between two processors using the MSI protocol.
This simulation was performed using SMPCache which is a trace-driven simulator for the analysis and teaching of cache memory systems on symmetric multiprocessors.
